# Mobile Flashcard Project (Udacity React Nanodegree Program)

This is a React Native project for the [Udacity React Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

## Introduction

Mobile Flashcard is a mobile app that runs on both iPhones and Android phones. You can create cards by entering a question and its answer. You can organize cards into card decks. You can test yourself using the cards in a deck. After completing the test, you will be shown a score of how well you memorize the cards. You can even turn on the notification so that the app will remind your to work on the cards every day!

## Installation

Please download this project and run the following script in the project directory:

`yarn`

## Instruction

After installing the necessary node packages, the following commands are available to you:

`yarn start`

This command will open up a browser window, in which a QR code is provided.

Please download the Expo app in your mobile phone, and scan the QR code, so that the Expo app loads the flashcard app.

You have full control on your cards and decks. Here is what you can do in the flashcard app:
